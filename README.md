KMRNext (tentative name)
========================

BACKEND RUNTIME
---------------

This software has two backends to manage data and tasks.

* serial
* kmr

"serial" backend uses only one node and "kmr" backend uses multiple nodes to
run in parallel.

INSTALL
-------

Building this software with the "serial" backend requires a C++ compiler that
supports C++98 standard.  Doing with the "kmr" backend requires an MPI
library that supports MPI 2.2. and KMR (http://mt.aics.riken.jp/kmr), in
addition.

This software can be build by a usual building flow, `configure`, `make` and
`make install`. To switch the backend, specify options to the configure
script.  The default backend is "serial".

* configure with the "serial" backend

        $ ./configure --prefix=PATH_TO_INSTALL_DIR
        $ make
        $ make install

* configure with the "kmr" backend

        $ ./configure --prefix=PATH_TO_INSTALL_DIR \
          --with-backend=kmr --with-kmr=PATH_TO_KMR_DIR
        $ make
        $ make install

By default, this software is installed with OpenMP enabled if the compiler
supports OpenMP.  If you want to disable OpenMP, specify `--disable-openmp`
option to the configure script.

To enable DEBUG mode, specify `--enable-debug` option to the configure script.

To disable the validation checking of user inputs to API, specify
`--disable-validation` option to the configuration script.  Although this may
help improving performance, the program may perform an unexected behavior if
it contains misuse of the API.  The test codes in gtest directory will fail
when this option is specified.  Be careful to specify this option.

Thread Safety
-------------

This software is not designed to be thread safe.  Users should use some lock
libraries to protect a Datastore not to be inconsistent state when accessing
it from multiple threads at the same time.
